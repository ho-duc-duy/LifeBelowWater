      <h2>SDG 14: Life Below Water</h2>
      <p><em>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.</em></p>

      <hr>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
          This artwork, "Spiral Echoes," is an exploration of the unseen symphony of the ocean. Kate Stafford once said, “Although the sound is inaudible above water, depending on where you are or the time of year, the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or any forest.” This highlights how rich and alive our oceans truly are—teeming not just with marine life, but with sound and connection.
      </p>
      <p>
          Human-made noise from activities like shipping, drilling, and pollution that are drowning out that natural symphony. Under the mission of SDG 14, it's time we tune in.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Call-to-action</h3>
      <blockquote>
          <p>"Don't let the ocean's song be silenced by human noise. Don't let the real sound of the ocean be drowned out, bring back its natural song."</p>
      </blockquote>
