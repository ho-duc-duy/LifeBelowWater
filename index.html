        <h3>Abstract:</h3>
        <p>
          This artwork, "Life Below Water," is an exploration of the unseen symphony of the ocean. By using dashed spiral pattern to symbolize the deep ocean, the ripple effect to stand for the positive activites that human do to protect the ocean voice as well as sound effects to make users feel like they are really interacting with the sea. Kate Stafford once said, “Although the sound is inaudible above water, depending on where you are or the time of year, the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or any forest.” This highlights how rich and alive our oceans truly are—teeming not just with marine life, but with sound and connection. Human-made noise from activities like shipping, drilling, and pollution that are drowning out that natural symphony. Under the mission of SDG 14, it's time we tune in.

        <h3>Call-to-action:</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Don't let the real sound of the ocean be drowned out, bring back its natural song."</p>
        </blockquote>
