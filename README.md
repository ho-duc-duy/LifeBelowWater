# Life Below Water

“Life Below Water” is an abstract digital artwork that simulates the infinity and mystery of the ocean through a spiral network that is randomly generated each time it is run. Initially, the entire scene is muted in tone – symbolizing a calm ocean that is shrouded in noise pollution. As the viewer clicks or hovers over the canvas, ripples of light appear, spreading and awakening colored highlights – symbolizing the positive impact of humans listening to and protecting the ocean. Background audio and hover effects contribute to a multi-sensory experience where every movement has meaning. The piece is a gentle yet profound reminder to engage with the ocean consciously – to not only echo, but also be heard.

## Concept

This artwork aims to raise awareness about underwater noise pollution and the importance of preserving the natural soundscape of the ocean.

- **spiral pattern** represents infinite depth, mystery, and the acoustic layers of the sea.
- **Ripples** simulate both noise disruption and conservation efforts, as they scatter particles and temporarily restore their natural color.
- **Sound effects** immerse the user and symbolize the ocean's voice.

## Features

- Randomized spiral parameters on each run (tightness, strength, size frequency)
- Interactive ripple grid based on mouse movement
- Smooth ripple physics that displace and animate dots
- Real-time color transitions based on ripple activation
- Ambient background audio that plays on first interaction
- Hover sound effect while mouse is active
- Procedurally generated 5-color palette using HSB mode
- Optimized for 1920x1080 resolution and full-screen presentation

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
2. Move your mouse across the screen to create ripple waves.
3. Ripples will push away particles and light up nearby areas.
4. Reload the page to generate a new ocean pattern with random properties of dashed ellipse.
5. Enjoy the wide range of sound effects.
